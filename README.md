# Ka-Ro device BSP layer

This is a subset of the meta-karo BSP layer by Ka-Ro Electronics. It targets
on providing a thin Ka-Ro device support to regular Yocto builds. Its not an
official Ka-Ro product - its modified by kernel concepts. For questions or 
support inquiries about it please do contact info@kernelconcepts.de.

## Yocto status

This layer should be compatible with most recent Yocto layer (sumo, thud...) 
with a few limitations.
